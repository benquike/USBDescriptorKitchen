---------------- README for USBDescriptorKitchen ----------------

USBDescriptorKitchen is a tool that helps developers of USB firmwares to ease
the pain of calculating lengths of descriptors, fiddling with bits, dealing
with variable length fields etc.

It is written in wxPython and works well on Linux and Mac OS X.

The only output format currently supported is as plain C header file, and the
tool is also able to read back the file and reconstruct the descriptors.

There are possibly some bugs left, and definitely the list of supported
descriptors is incomplete. Feedback helping to improve things is always
welcome, preferrably in the form of proper git patches.
